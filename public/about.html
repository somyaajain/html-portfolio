<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello everyone! 
  My name is Somya Jain and this is my first web development project where I'm creating my portfolio website. 
  Your kindness and support during my journey would be highly appreciated. 
  As a beginner I'm a bit nervous but step by step under the guidance of my mentors, I'm sure I'll make it work.

  I'm an undergraduate B.tech student at G.L. Bajaj Institute of Technology and Management pursuing my degree in Computer Science and Enginnering specialising in Artificail Intelligence.
  I aced my classes and secured a good rank in high-school.
  Along with the acadmics I also love to do volunteer work and have been an active member of the Rotaract Club of my college.
  I'm an avid reader. Some of my favourite books are The Kite Runner, The Perks of Being a Wallflower and The Fault in Our Stars.
